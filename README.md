# SimpleOpenModLiteDB
Simple library for managing LiteDB databases easily from OpenMod

This library can be used for simple NoSQL storage in OpenMod. 

A quick overview:
* All LINQ supported
* Data can be shared across any plugins
* Fast
* Allows extensions and more case-oriented method

I will make 2 examples soon. 
Also I will post this on NuGet when I get to more useable state.
